                <h3>Evidence points to upcoming 6.3" Samsung Galaxy Note 3</h3>
                <p>
                	Is there a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 around the corner? And does it have a 6.3in screen? There's new evidence to suggest that the answer to both of these questions is “yes”.

                <p>
                	The Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone launched recently, and with it a microsite talking up accessories and the like. One of these accessories is a Nintendo-esque gamepad that connects to the S4 via Bluetooth. So far, so what. Well, there's one detail in the product description that catches the eye: it mentions support for 4" to 6.3" screen sizes.
                </p>
                <p>
                	Samsung doesn't currently make a device with a 6.3" screen, but the mention of it suggests that one is definitely coming. And with smartphone screens getting larger, we can only see the Note range going the same way. The current model, the Note 2, has a 5.5" screen, and a 6.3" for its successor seems totally plausible.
